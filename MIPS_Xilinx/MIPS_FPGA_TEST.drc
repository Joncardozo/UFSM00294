WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   PROCESSOR/GND_17_o_PWR_14_o_OR_41_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.

   PROCESSOR/result[1]_result[1]_OR_76_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
